The provided Python script simulates a distributed system using SQLite databases for three different models: Users, Products, and Orders. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

Database Setup: The script defines three database file names corresponding to each model. It also prepares the data to be inserted into each database.

Insertion Functions: Three functions (insert_users, insert_products, and insert_orders) are defined to handle the insertion of data into their respective databases. Each function:

Connects to the appropriate SQLite database.
Creates the necessary table if it does not exist.
Executes multiple insert operations using executemany, which is efficient for bulk inserts.
Commits the transaction and closes the connection.
Threading: The script utilizes the threading module to create separate threads for each insertion function. This allows for concurrent execution, simulating a distributed system where multiple operations can occur simultaneously.

Execution: The threads are started, and the main program waits for all threads to complete using join(). Finally, a message is printed to indicate that all insertions have been completed.

This approach effectively demonstrates how to manage multiple data models in a distributed system while ensuring that application-level validations are handled appropriately.
